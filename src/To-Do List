Workout:
to verify:
1. create workout instances fields on the stack?
2. to implement only : constructor, copy constructor?
3. should we implement copy assignment operator? Workout class fields are const therefore
   copy assignment operator is not reasonable.
4. should we overload Destructor?


Workout finished members:
id, name, price, type
constructor , copy constructor , getId, getName, getPrice, getType
